Lexicon of a language means the collection of words and phrases in a language. Lexical analysis is dividing the whole chunk of txt into paragraphs, sentences, and words.\\n\\nSyntactic Analysis (Parsing) âˆ’ It involves analysis of words in the sentence for grammar and arranging words in a manner that shows the relationship among the words. The sentence such as â€œThe school goes to boyâ€� is rejected by English syntactic analyzer.\\n\\nNLP Steps\\nSemantic Analysis âˆ’ It draws the exact meaning or the dictionary meaning from the text. The text is checked for meaningfulness. It is done by mapping syntactic structures and objects in the task domain. The semantic analyzer disregards sentence such as â€œhot ice-creamâ€�.\\n\\nDiscourse Integration âˆ’ The meaning of any sentence depends upon the meaning of the sentence just before it. In addition, it also brings about the meaning of immediately succeeding sentence.\\n\\nPragmatic Analysis âˆ’ During this, what was said is re-interpreted on what it actually meant. It involves deriving those aspects of language which require real world knowledge.\\n\\nImplementation Aspects of Syntactic Analysis\\nThere are a number of algorithms researchers have developed for syntactic analysis, but we consider only the following simple methods âˆ’\\n\\nContext-Free Grammar\\nTop-Down Parser\\nLet us see them in detail âˆ’\\n\\nContext-Free Grammar\\nIt is the grammar that consists rules with a single symbol on the left-hand side of the rewrite rules. Let us create grammar to parse a sentence âˆ’\\n\\nâ€œThe bird pecks the grainsâ€�\\n\\n\\nNouns âˆ’ bird | birds | grain | grains\\n\\nNoun Phrase (NP) âˆ’ Article + Noun | Article + Adjective + Noun\\n\\n= DET N | DET ADJ N\\n\\nVerbs âˆ’ pecks | pecking | pecked\\n\\nVerb Phrase (VP) âˆ’ NP V | V NP\\n\\nAdjectives (ADJ) âˆ’ beautiful | small | chirping\\n\\nThe parse tree breaks down the sentence into structured parts so that the computer can easily understand and process it. In order for the parsing algorithm to construct this parse tree, a set of rewrite rules, which describe what tree structures are legal, need to be constructed.\\n\\nThese rules say that a certain symbol may be expanded in the tree by a sequence of other symbols. According to first order logic rule, if there are two strings Noun Phrase (NP) and Verb Phrase (VP), then the string combined by NP followed by VP is a sentence. The rewrite rules for the sentence are as follows âˆ’\\n\\nS â†’ NP VP\\n\\nNP â†’ DET N | DET ADJ N\\n\\nVP â†’ V NP\\n\\nLexocon âˆ’\\n\\nDET â†’ a | the\\n\\nADJ â†’ beautiful | perching\\n\\nN â†’ bird | birds | grain | grains\\n\\nV â†’ peck | pecks | pecking\\n\\nThe parse tree can be created as shown âˆ’\\n\\nNLP Steps\\nNow consider the above rewrite rules. Since V can be replaced by both, \"peck\" or \"pecks\", sentences such as \"The bird peck the grains\" can be wrongly permitted. i. e. the subject-verb agreement error is approved as correct.\\n\\nMerit âˆ’ The simplest style of grammar, therefore widely used one.\\n\\nDemerits âˆ’\\n\\nThey are not highly precise. For example, â€œThe grains peck the birdâ€�, is a syntactically correct according to parser, but even if it makes no sense, parser takes it as a correct sentence.\\n\\nTo bring out high precision, multiple sets of grammar need to be prepared. It may require a completely different sets of rules for parsing singular and plural variations, passive sentences, etc., which can lead to creation of huge set of rules that are unmanageable.\\n\\nTop-Down Parser\\nHere, the parser starts with the S symbol and attempts to rewrite it into a sequence of terminal symbols that matches the classes of the words in the input sentence until it consists entirely of terminal symbols.\\n\\nThese are then checked with the input sentence to see if it matched. If not, the process is started over again with a different set of rules. This is repeated until a specific rule is found which describes the structure of the sentence.\\n\\nMerit âˆ’ It is simple to implement.\\n\\nDemerits âˆ’\\n\\nIt is inefficient, as the search process has to be repeated if an error occurs.\\nSlow speed of working.'"

       "{'text': 'Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to AI method of communicating with an intelligent systems using a natural language such as English.\\n\\nProcessing of Natural Language is required when you want an intelligent system like robot to perform as per your instructions, when you want to hear decision from a dialogue based clinical expert system, etc.\\n\\nThe field of NLP involves making computers to perform useful tasks with the natural languages humans use. The input and output of an NLP system can be âˆ’\\n\\nSpeech\\nWritten Text\\nComponents of NLP\\nThere are two components of NLP as given âˆ’\\n\\nNatural Language Understanding (NLU)\\nUnderstanding involves the following tasks âˆ’\\n\\nMapping the given input in natural language into useful representations.\\nAnalyzing different aspects of the language.\\nNatural Language Generation (NLG)\\nIt is the process of producing meaningful phrases and sentences in the form of natural language from some internal representation.\\n\\nIt involves âˆ’\\n\\nText planning âˆ’ It includes retrieving the relevant content from knowledge base.\\n\\nSentence planning âˆ’ It includes choosing required words, forming meaningful phrases, setting tone of the sentence.\\n\\nText Realization âˆ’ It is mapping sentence plan into sentence structure.\\n\\nThe NLU is harder than NLG.\\n\\nDifficulties in NLU\\nNL has an extremely rich form and structure.\\n\\nIt is very ambiguous. There can be different levels of ambiguity âˆ’\\n\\nLexical ambiguity âˆ’ It is at very primitive level such as word-level.\\n\\nFor example, treating the word â€œboardâ€� as noun or verb?\\n\\nSyntax Level ambiguity âˆ’ A sentence can be parsed in different ways.\\n\\nFor example, â€œHe lifted the beetle with red cap.â€� âˆ’ Did he use cap to lift the beetle or he lifted a beetle that had red cap?\\n\\nReferential ambiguity âˆ’ Referring to something using pronouns. For example, Rima went to Gauri. She said, â€œI am tired.â€� âˆ’ Exactly who is tired?\\n\\nOne input can mean different meanings.\\n\\nMany inputs can mean the same thing.\\n\\nNLP Terminology\\nPhonology âˆ’ It is study of organizing sound systematically.\\n\\nMorphology âˆ’ It is a study of construction of words from primitive meaningful units.\\n\\nMorpheme âˆ’ It is primitive unit of meaning in a language.\\n\\nSyntax âˆ’ It refers to arranging words to make a sentence. It also involves determining the structural role of words in the sentence and in phrases.\\n\\nSemantics âˆ’ It is concerned with the meaning of words and how to combine words into meaningful phrases and sentences.\\n\\nPragmatics âˆ’ It deals with using and understanding sentences in different situations and how the interpretation of the sentence is affected.\\n\\nDiscourse âˆ’ It deals with how the immediately preceding sentence can affect the interpretation of the next sentence.\\n\\nWorld Knowledge âˆ’ It includes the general knowledge about the world.\\n\\nSteps in NLP\\nThere are general five steps âˆ’\\n\\nLexical Analysis âˆ’ It involves identifying and analyzing the structure of words. Lexicon of a language means the collection of words and phrases in a language. Lexical analysis is dividing the whole chunk of txt into paragraphs, sentences, and words.\\n\\nSyntactic Analysis (Parsing) âˆ’ It involves analysis of words in the sentence for grammar and arranging words in a manner that shows the relationship among the words. The sentence such as â€œThe school goes to boyâ€� is rejected by English syntactic analyzer.\\n\\nNLP Steps\\nSemantic Analysis âˆ’ It draws the exact meaning or the dictionary meaning from the text. The text is checked for meaningfulness. It is done by mapping syntactic structures and objects in the task domain. The semantic analyzer disregards sentence such as â€œhot ice-creamâ€�.\\n\\nDiscourse Integration âˆ’ The meaning of any sentence depends upon the meaning of the sentence just before it. In addition, it also brings about the meaning of immediately succeeding sentence.\\n\\nPragmatic Analysis âˆ’ During this, what was said is re-interpreted on what it actually meant. It involves deriving those aspects of language which require real world knowledge.\\n\\nImplementation Aspects of Syntactic Analysis\\nThere are a number of algorithms researchers have developed for syntactic analysis, but we consider only the following simple methods âˆ’\\n\\nContext-Free Grammar\\nTop-Down Parser\\nLet us see them in detail âˆ’\\n\\nContext-Free Grammar\\nIt is the grammar that consists rules with a single symbol on the left-hand side of the rewrite rules. Let us create grammar to parse a sentence âˆ’\\n\\nâ€œThe bird pecks the grainsâ€�\\n\\n\\nNouns âˆ’ bird | birds | grain | grains\\n\\nNoun Phrase (NP) âˆ’ Article + Noun | Article + Adjective + Noun\\n\\n= DET N | DET ADJ N\\n\\nVerbs âˆ’ pecks | pecking | pecked\\n\\nVerb Phrase (VP) âˆ’ NP V | V NP\\n\\nAdjectives (ADJ) âˆ’ beautiful | small | chirping\\n\\nThe parse tree breaks down the sentence into structured parts so that the computer can easily understand and process it. In order for the parsing algorithm to construct this parse tree, a set of rewrite rules, which describe what tree structures are legal, need to be constructed.\\n\\nThese rules say that a certain symbol may be expanded in the tree by a sequence of other symbols. According to first order logic rule, if there are two strings Noun Phrase (NP) and Verb Phrase (VP), then the string combined by NP followed by VP is a sentence. The rewrite rules for the sentence are as follows âˆ’\\n\\nS â†’ NP VP\\n\\nNP â†’ DET N | DET ADJ N\\n\\nVP â†’ V NP\\n\\nLexocon âˆ’\\n\\nDET â†’ a | the\\n\\nADJ â†’ beautiful | perching\\n\\nN â†’ bird | birds | grain | grains\\n\\nV â†’ peck | pecks | pecking\\n\\nThe parse tree can be created as shown âˆ’\\n\\nNLP Steps\\nNow consider the above rewrite rules. Since V can be replaced by both, \"peck\" or \"pecks\", sentences such as \"The bird peck the grains\" can be wrongly permitted. i. e. the subject-verb agreement error is approved as correct.\\n\\nMerit âˆ’ The simplest style of grammar, therefore widely used one.\\n\\nDemerits âˆ’\\n\\nThey are not highly precise. For example, â€œThe grains peck the birdâ€�, is a syntactically correct according to parser, but even if it makes no sense, parser takes it as a correct sentence.\\n\\nTo bring out high precision, multiple sets of grammar need to be prepared. It may require a completely different sets of rules for parsing singular and plural variations, passive sentences, etc., which can lead to creation of huge set of rules that are unmanageable.\\n\\nTop-Down Parser\\nHere, the parser starts with the S symbol and attempts to rewrite it into a sequence of terminal symbols that matches the classes of the words in the input sentence until it consists entirely of terminal symbols.\\n\\nThese are then checked with the input sentence to see if it matched. If not, the process is started over again with a different set of rules. This is repeated until a specific rule is found which describes the structure of the sentence.\\n\\nMerit âˆ’ It is simple to implement.\\n\\nDemerits âˆ’\\n\\nIt is inefficient, as the search process has to be repeated if an error occurs.\\nSlow speed of working.',\n",
